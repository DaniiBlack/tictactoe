## Installation
Please follow this link [Dani's TIC-TAC-TOE](https://daniiblack.github.io/project0/) to access the game.

### Steps
1. Open the webpage.
2. Grab your bestest imaginary friend, your mother, father, cousin, or anyone you feel needs *a good thrashing* and get started!

**Don't overthink it:**
- Two player game, you must play from the same webpage on the same device.
- Consider playing a quick round of **paperScissorsRock**, whoever wins gets to start.
- Remember to ensure the loser has to do some unfavorable chores. Keep the stakes high for maximum enjoyment.

## Usage
1. Click on a cell to make your move.
2. The game will alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
3. The first player to get three in a row wins.
4. Click the "Rematch" button to start a new game.

## Technology Used
1. HTML
2. JavaScript
3. DOM manipulation
4. Markdown
5. Some sprinkles of CSS
6. Git and GitHub

## Challenges
1. Getting the styling to resize so that the game could be played on a phone (without using Bootstrap).
2. Refining the logic in the JavaScript in order to try and keep the code short and succinct.
3. I put CSS off to last, and ran out of time to make the game as pretty as it deserves to be.
4. The main bug I came across was that the Player rendered (player1 or 2) broke and I had to mess about with the order of the functions to fix.
